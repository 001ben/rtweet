#' GET direct_messages
#'
#' Returns the 20 most recent direct messages sent to the authenticating
#'   user. Includes detailed information about the sender and recipient user.
#'   You can request up to 200 direct messages per call, and only the most
#'   recent 200 DMs will be available using this endpoint. Important: This
#'   method requires an access token with RWD (read, write & direct
#'   message) permissions.
#' @param since_id optional Returns results with an ID greater than (that is,
#'   more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the number of
#'   Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has
#'   occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID
#'   available.
#' @param max_id optional Returns results with an ID less than (that is,
#'   older than) or equal to the specified ID.
#' @param count optional Specifies the number of direct messages to try and
#'   retrieve, up to a maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as
#'   a limit to the number of Tweets to return because suspended or deleted
#'   content is removed after the count has been applied.
#' @param token OAuth token. By default \code{token = NULL} fetches a
#'   non-exhausted token from an environment variable. Find
#'   instructions on how to create tokens and setup an environment
#'   variable in the tokens vignette (in r, send \code{?tokens} to
#'   console).
