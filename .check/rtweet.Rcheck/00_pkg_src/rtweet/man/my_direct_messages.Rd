\usage{
my_direct_messages(since_id = NULL, max_id = NULL, count = 200,
  parse = TRUE, token = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{since_id}{optional Returns results with an ID greater than (that is,
more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the number of
Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has
occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID
available.}

\item{max_id}{optional Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older
than) or equal to the specified ID.}

\item{count}{optional Specifies the number of direct messages to try and
retrieve, up to a maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as
a limit to the number of Tweets to return because suspended or deleted
content is removed after the count has been applied.}

\item{parse}{Logical indicating whether to convert response object into
nested list. Defaults to true.}

\item{token}{OAuth token. By default \code{token = NULL} fetches a
non-exhausted token from an environment variable. Find instructions on how
to create tokens and setup an environment variable in the tokens vignette
(in r, send \code{?tokens} to console).}
}
\value{
Return object converted to nested list. If status code of response
  object is not 200, the response object is returned directly.
}
