\usage{
search_tweets(q, n = 100, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Query to be searched, used to filter and select tweets
to return from Twitter's REST API. Must be a character string not
to exceed maximum of 500 characters. Spaces behave like boolean
"AND" operator. To search for tweets containing at least one of
multiple possible terms, separate each search term with spaces
and "OR" (in caps). For example, the search
\code{q = "data science"} looks for tweets containing both
"data" and "science" anywhere located anywhere in the tweets and
in any order. When "OR" is entered between search terms,
\code{query = "data OR science"}, Twitter's REST API should return
any tweet that contains either "data" or
"science." It is also possible to search for exact phrases using
double quotes. To do this, either wrap single quotes around a
search query using double quotes, e.g.,
\code{q = '"data science"'} or escape each internal double quote
with a single backslash, e.g., \code{q = "\"data science\""}.}

\item{n}{Integer, specifying the total number of desired tweets to
return. Defaults to 100. Maximum number of tweets returned from
a single token is 18,000. To return more than 18,000 tweets, users
are encouraged to set \code{retryonratelimit} to TRUE. See details
for more information.}
