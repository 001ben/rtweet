\description{
Retrieve the identified Collection, presented as a list of the
  Tweets curated within. The response structure of this method
  differs significantly from timelines you may be used to
  working with in the Twitter REST API. To navigate a
  Collection, use the position object of a response, which includes
  attributes for max_position, min_position, and was_truncated.
  was_truncated indicates whether additional Tweets exist in
  the collection outside of the range of the current request.
  To retrieve Tweets further back in time, use the value of
  min_position found in the current response as the max_position
  parameter in your next call to this endpoint.
