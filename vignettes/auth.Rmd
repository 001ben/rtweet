## rtweet

This vignette covers how to obtain and use Twitter API access tokens
for use in the `rtweet` package.

```{r}
# install from CRAN
install.packages("rtweet")

# load rtweet
library(rtweet)
```

## Creating a Twitter App

- To create a Twitter app, navigate to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and create a new app by providing a `Name`, `Description`, and `Website` of your choosing (example screenshot provided below).

- **Important** In the `Callback URL` field, make sure to enter the following: `http://127.0.0.1:1410`

- Check yes if you agree and then click "Create your Twitter application".

- Next, click the tab labeled `Keys and Access Tokens` to retrieve your keys.

- Users can create their personal access token in two different ways. Each method is outlined below.

### Browser-based authentication method

- Authentication via web browser requires the `httpuv` package to be installed.

```{r}
## install httpuv if not already
if (!requireNamespace("httpuv", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("httpuv")
}
```

- In the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab, locate the values `Consumer Key` (aka "API Key") and `Consumer Secret` (aka "API Secret").

<p align="center">
<img src="files/keys.png" alt="keys">
</p>

- Copy and paste the two keys (along with the name of your app) into an R script file and assign them to objects as is done in the code below.

```{r}
## whatever name you assigned to your created app
appname <- "rtweet_token"

## api key (example below is not a real key)
key <- "XYznzPFOFZR2a39FwWKN1Jp41"

## api secret (example below is not a real key)
secret <- "CtkGEWmSevZqJuKl6HHrBxbCybxI1xGLqrD5ynPd9jG0SoHZbD"
```

- Once the keys are read into R, pass the objects to `create_token()`, and store the output as `twitter_token`.

```{r}
## create token and save it as an environment variable
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret)
```

- A browser window should pop up. Click to approve and return to R.

- The `create_token()` function should automatically save your token as an environment variable for you. To make sure it worked, compare the created token object to the object returned by `get_token()`

```{r}
## check to see if the token is loaded
identical(twitter_token, get_token())
```


### Oauth signature method

- In the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab, locate the values `Consumer Key` (aka "API Key") and `Consumer Secret` (aka "API Secret").

<p align="center">
<img src="files/keys.png" alt="keys">
</p>

- In the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab, scroll down to `Token Actions` and click `Create my access token`. That should generate two access keys, i.e. `Access Token` and `Access Token Secret`.

<p align="center">

</p>

- Copy and paste the four keys (along with the name of your app) into an R script file and assign them to objects as is done in the code below.

```{r}
## whatever name you assigned to your created app
appname <- "rtweet_token"

## api key (example below is not a real key)
key <- "XYznzPFOFZR2a39FwWKN1Jp41"

## api secret (example below is not a real key)
secret <- "CtkGEWmSevZqJuKl6HHrBxbCybxI1xGLqrD5ynPd9jG0SoHZbD"

## access token (example below is not a real key)
acess_token <- "9551451262-wK2EmA942kxZYIwa5LMKZoQA4Xc2uyIiEwu2YXL"

## access secret (example below is not a real key)
access_secret <- "9vpiSGKg1fIPQtxc5d5ESiFlZQpfbknEN1f1m2xe5byw7"
```

- Once the keys are read into R, pass the objects to `create_token()`, and store the output as `twitter_token`.

```{r}
## create token and save it as an environment variable
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_secret
)
```

- The `create_token()` function should automatically save your token as an environment variable for you. To make sure it worked, compare the created token object to the object returned by `get_token()`

```{r}
## check to see if the token is loaded
identical(twitter_token, get_token())
```



That's it!
